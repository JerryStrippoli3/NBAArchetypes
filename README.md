# NBAArchetypes
This project uses unsupervised machine learning to cluster NBA players into performance-based archetypes (e.g., Inside Scorer, All-Around) using K-Means and PCA. It includes full data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and cluster visualization, with a focus on interpreting player roles and comparing team compositions.
